TO INSTALL, simply install and enable the module, in these steps.

PLEASE CHECK, that you use the right version of Taxonomy Access for DRUPAL.
  (For 4.7.x, use taxonomy_access-4.7.0.tar.gz)

IMPORTANT: This is a complicated module. When you try to learn using this module,
  ALWAYS TRY IT FIRST ON A TEST SITE.

NOTE: If you want to USE TWO OR MORE "ACCESS" MODULE AT THE SAME TIME, TEST IT 
      CAREFULLY. (e.g: OG, node_privacy_by_role, taxonomy access, etc.)
     (This has been made easier with the new node_access system in 5.x.)

TO UPDATE from previous versions of taxonomy_access: PLEASE READ UPDATE.TXT!
  WHEN UPDATING, ALWAYS disable the module first (admin/modules) before uploading
  the new module.

   module directory (by default: /sites/all/modules/taxonomy_access/)
